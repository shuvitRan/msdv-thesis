## Outline
With the help of The Nature Conservancy, taking a frontier Chinese city Shenzhen as an example,  I am visualizing urban environment-related problems that many cities face today and creating an interactive guide to show people the practical solutions that they can act on the problems. My aim of this project is to show the significance of sustainable urban development and get people involved to improve their city environment.

### Topics:
#### The Environmental problems that Cities face today.
Present the statistics on water demand and wastewater problems.

#### Urban Heat Island Problem
Visualize the Urban Heat Island data of Shenzhen.

#### Storm Water Problem
Visualize the flooding and other problems caused by stormwater.

#### Build your own Green Roof
An interactive tool to guide people to build a green roof in order to make the city more sustainable by reducing the heat island effect and saving more water.   

### Potential Topics:   

#### Climate Changes
Extreme weather Data visualization

#### Porous Pavement/ Rain Harvest and Reuse System/ Constructed Wetlands.
Explanation of different natural infrastructures' benefits.

#### Data Source:
The Nature Conservancy.
Shenzhen Gov Open Data.
NYC Open Data.
National Centers for Environmental Information
